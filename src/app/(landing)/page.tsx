  const questionAnswers = [
    {
      question: `How does the leet code cipher work?`,

    },
    {
      question: `Is it safe to store all my passwords in one place?`,
      answer: `Yes, it's safe when done correctly. We use state-of-the-art encryption to protect your stored passwords. In fact, it's often safer than using the same password across multiple sites or writing them down.`,
    },
    {
      question: `Can I use the Password Cypher App on multiple devices?`,
      answer: `Yes, our Cypher Pro and Enterprise plans support multi-device sync, allowing you to access your passwords securely from any device.`,

      question: `What happens if I forget my master password?`,
      answer: `For security reasons, we cannot recover your master password. However, we offer secure password reset options that don't compromise the safety of your stored passwords.`,
